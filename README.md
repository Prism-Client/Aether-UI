# Aether UI

<img src="/docs/assets/client-logo-rounded.png" align="right" width="230" height="230">
 
**Aether is a UI component library engine for Minecraft** and LWJGL projects (or anything really). You can create your own renderer implementation or use the default implementation with *[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg "An anti-aliased vector graphics library")*, which is an **Anti-Aliased vector graphics library**. **Please note the project is in the early stages of development.** Bugs may arise, and there might be incomplete/missing features. The libary is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2).

Aether is [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming), so you describe what you want, not how to do what you want. The engine should be used with Kotlin; however, it can be used with Java.
