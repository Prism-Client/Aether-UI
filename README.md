# Aether UI


<img src="/docs/assets/client-logo-rounded.png" align="right" width="230" height="230">
 
**Aether is a UI component library engine for Minecraft** and LWJGL projects (or anything really). You can create your own renderer implementation or use the default implementation with *[NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg "An anti-aliased vector graphics library")*, which is an **Anti-Aliased vector graphics library**. **Please note the project is in the early stages of development.** Bugs may arise, and there might be incomplete/missing features. I have not chosen a license for the project. The discord server for the parent project can be found [here](https://discord.gg/jg3aWfASPp).

In a future release, the ability to import designs directly from figma, and to load actual css will be added.
